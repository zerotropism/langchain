        Hey there customer,
        the warranty does not cover
        cleaning expenses for your kitchen
        because it's your fault that
        you misused your blender
        by forgetting to put the lid on before
        starting the blender.
        Tough luck! See ya!

        This leaf blower is pretty amazing. It has four settings:
        candle blower, gentle breeze, windy city, and tornado.
        It arrived in two days, just in time for my wife's
        anniversary present.
        I think my wife liked it so much she was speechless.
        So far I've been the only one using it, and I've been
        using it every other morning to clear the leaves on our lawn.
        It's slightly more expensive than the other leaf blowers
        out there, but I think it's worth it for the extra features.
